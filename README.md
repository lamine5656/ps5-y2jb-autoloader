## How to Use

There are two ways to use the autoloader:

### 🟢 Option 1: Payload Manager

If no `autoload.txt` config is found, the autoloader will automatically launch **[Payload Manager](https://github.com/itsPLK/ps5-payload-manager)** — a fully-featured PS5 payload manager with a web UI. This lets you configure and send payloads directly from your browser, without needing to manually set up config files or transfer ELF files ahead of time.

Just run the autoloader — if there's nothing configured, Payload Manager starts automatically.

> **Note:** Payload Manager also has its own built-in autoload feature, which lets you configure payloads to load automatically on startup — all managed through its web UI. This is separate from the `autoload.txt` mechanism described below.

---

### ⚙️ Option 2: Manual Config (`autoload.txt`)

For a fixed, automated payload chain, you can configure payloads manually:

- Create a directory named `ps5_autoloader`.
- Inside this directory, place your `.elf` / `.bin` files, and an `autoload.txt` file.
  - In `autoload.txt`, list the files you want to load, one filename per line.
  - Filenames are case-sensitive — ensure each name exactly matches the file.
  - You can add lines like `!1000` to make the loader wait 1000 ms before sending the next payload.
- Put the `ps5_autoloader` directory in one of these locations (priority order - highest first):
  - Root of a USB drive
  - Internal drive: `/data/ps5_autoloader`

> **Note:** When an `autoload.txt` config is found, Payload Manager is **not** launched automatically. If you also want Payload Manager available, place `pldmgr.elf` in your `ps5_autoloader` directory and add it to `autoload.txt`.

## How to Update

You can update the autoloader by simply placing **`y2jb_update.zip`** (from the [Releases page](https://github.com/lamine5656/ps5-y2jb-autoloader/releases)) on the **root** of a USB drive, and starting the app.

## Setup Instructions

Installation is the same as the original [Y2JB](https://github.com/Gezine/Y2JB/blob/main/README.md) (remote loader).


### Jailbroken PS5 (Webkit, Lua, BD-JB)

Install YouTube (`PPSA01650` / `PPSA01651` / `PPSA01652`):

| Firmware | YouTube Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| **4.03 – 12.40** | `v01.000.003` |
| **12.60 – 13.20** | `v01.000.030` |
| **13.40 – 13.60** | `v01.009.253` |

Then FTP `download0.dat` from Releases to `/user/download/PPSA0165*/`.

### Non-Jailbroken PS5
You might find a system backup with pre-configured Autoloader (I don't distribute such backups).

You can also restore [Y2JB](https://github.com/Gezine/Y2JB) (remote loader) system backup, and then:
- use FTP to place `download0.dat` from releases page in `/user/download/PPSA01650`
- or install separate YT app from different region, and use FTP to place `download0.dat` from releases page in `/user/download/PPSA0165*/`

> [!NOTE]
> Firmwares 10.20–13.60 run Relapse, which requires an active network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet connected to a local network; Internet access is not required).

## Additional Info

<Details>
<Summary><i>How to have different autoload configs for multiple YT apps?</i></Summary>

If you want to use multiple YT apps from different regions,
name your directory <code>ps5_autoloader_[TITLE_ID]</code>, e.g. <code>ps5_autoloader_PPSA01650</code>
this will allow you to have different autoload.txt files for each app
(these directories always take precedence over the generic ps5_autoloader directory)

<Details>
<Summary><i>How to use custom ELF Loader version?</i></Summary>

By default, the autoloader uses a custom version of **elfldr** that only accepts connections from the PS5 itself (localhost). This improves security by preventing other devices on your network from sending payloads to your console.

If you want to use a "normal" ELF Loader that allows sending payloads from any device:
1. Place your custom ELF Loader (e.g. `elfldr.elf`) in the `ps5_autoloader` directory.
2. Add `elfldr.elf` to your `autoload.txt`.
3. **Note**: If you are loading other payloads right after `elfldr.elf` in your `autoload.txt`, add a sleep command immediately after it (like `!4000` to sleep for 4 seconds) to give the new ELF Loader time to start up and listen before subsequent payloads are sent.

Example `autoload.txt`:
```text
# Load custom ELF Loader
elfldr.elf
# Give it 4 seconds to start up (only needed if sending more payloads)
!4000
# Send other payloads
etaHEN.elf
```
